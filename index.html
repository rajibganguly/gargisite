					time with Anamitra as my Executive Coach. It started a journey of over a decade where I not only grew professionally and personally<br />
                    but importantly started my own coaching journey which has been profoundly fulfilling. I wish him the very best and joy,<br />
                     fulfilment and growth to his coachees.”<br /><br />

                        <p>“Anamitra helped us reflect and understand ourselves not just as professionals but also as individuals. His coaching sessions transformed <br />
                            my thinking and provided a much better view of the path I intend to walk in our professional and personal lives. This coaching reinforced <br />
                            within me fresh ideas on people perspective. At the end of the coaching sessions with Anamitra, we realised that as a team we were <br />
                            better connected to ourselves, our people, our client organisations and our business’’<br /><br />

                            <p>“Anamitra as Executive Coach and Trainer, inspires us to think beyond our limitations. He challenges the barriers and internal interferences that<br />
                                keeps an individual from attaining full potential. I have experienced that Anamitra, with his hard work, planning and dedication never deviates<br />
                                from the Primary Task. His painstakingly taught, harmoniously encapsulated, and brilliantly delivered leadership development sessions <br />
                                fascinate me, and nourishes my curiosity. I have had the opportunity to interact with Anamitra closely. Being a non-judgmental person, <br />
                                he has an open mindset. He listens actively. It has been also fun to know and be with Anamitra.”<br /><br />
